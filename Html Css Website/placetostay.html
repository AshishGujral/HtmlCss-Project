                Rising like a mirage from Lake Pichola, the white-marble-and-mosaic Taj Lake Palace beckons to travelers. 
                The palace itself dates back to 1746, when it was built by Maharana Jagat Singh II.
                 Today, guests are treated like royalty by an entourage of palace butlers who ensure that every creature comfort is provided.
                  The Jiva Spa draws rich idioms from millennia-old Indian wellness and healing therapies, resulting in a menu of aromatherapy massages, body scrubs and wraps that are sure to rejuvenate even the weariest body.
                   From mid-October to mid-April, the hotel’s rooftop Bhairo restaurant is open and serves contemporary European cuisine with spectacular palace lake and views.

                The phenomenal Oberoi Udaivilas is spread over 50 acres on the banks of Lake Pichola, on the 200-year-old hunting grounds of the Maharana of Mewar.
                 The resort offers unique experiences that include private lakeside dining, traditional boat rides, private cooking sessions and fun activities for children.
                  The indoor and alfresco restaurants have lake and garden views, and serve fine international and Indian cuisine, while the spa offers signature Oberoi treatments.
                   I recommend to opt for a suite with a private pool, or for a premier room with comes with direct access to a unique 240 ft (73 m) long semi-private pool and a bath tub with uninterrupted lake views.
