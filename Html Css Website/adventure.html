                Jaipur is not known as one of the many adventure places in India, but traditionally, it is known for its heritage tourism. 
                However, you can now experience the thrill of a hot air balloon tour.
                You can either choose to train in the science of hot air ballooning and then perform the activity under guided supervision or you can take a hot air balloon tour.
                The tour throws an entirely new perspective on Rajasthan and will give you a bird’s eye view of the cities of Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Jaipur.
