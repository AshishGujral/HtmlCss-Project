                India Gate is without a doubt one of the most recognizable structures of the country. 
                Often referred as the replica of Arc de Triomphe in Paris, this majestic monument is dedicated to those 70,000 soldiers who lost their lives during World War I.
                Completed in 1931; India Gate stands 42m tall in height with name of the Indian martyrs carved on it. 
                The Amar Jawan Jyoti is a much later addition to the structure, which was created after 1971’s Indo-Pak war. 
                Today, India Gate is amongst the most famous monuments in Delhi and India.

                The Red Fort is the most popular and important of the forts in India.
                 It was constructed under the leadership of Shah Jahan and since then has been home to various nobles and kings.
                Once, the fort’s facade was graciously decorated with diamonds, but over the years the diamonds were stripped off as kings lost their wealth. 
                Today, the Red Fort is an important landmark and is used for the Prime Minister’s address to the nation on Independence Day.
